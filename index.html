                        <p>
                            I was tasked with building
                            <a
                                href="https://creature.world"
                                target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                                >creature.world</a
                            >, an online hub for Danny Cole’s Creature World art
                            series (and other projects). Using the tools listed
                            above, I created an animated homepage screen, an
                            “explore” page containing all of Danny’s projects,
                            an “info” page with Danny’s bio, and a Shopify merch
                            store, seamlessly integrated into the site.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Refinement</h2>
                        <p>
                            To start off the project, I was handed some
                            low-fidelity prototypes, and given the job of
                            fleshing out their designs and implementing them.
                        </p>

                            </div>
                            <div class="image-block">
                                <img

                                    alt="Hand-drawn prototype of creature world store page"
                                />
                                <div>Store</div>
                            </div>

                        <p>
                            Clearly, the website designs needed a bit of
                            refining - so I got to work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I began by asking fundamental questions about the
                            minimum necessary information required on each page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After some questioning, I found out the following:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The homepage needed animations on page load and
                                links to other pages
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The info page needed the client's bio and
                                animations
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The store needed a functional storefront and
                                checkout, along with animations
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The archive needed a curated list of “selected
                                projects” as well as an artwork gallery and the
                                ability to see all of Danny’s past projects
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Next, I asked about the design language they wanted
                            to follow.
                        </p>
                        <p>They told me:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Primary and secondary site colours (blue and
                                gold)
                            </li>
                            <li>Desired website font (Alte Haas Grotesk)</li>
                            <li>The vibe (fun!)</li>
                            <li>The style (pixelation whenever possible)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Ok, I can work with that!</p>
                        <p>
                            One thing to note before we get started: I was on a
                            tight timeline for this project, so I was unable to
                            iterate on designs as much as I would have liked.
                            Instead of building out low-fidelity prototypes
                            before implementing, I often jumped straight into
                            implementation due to the time constraint. Was this
                            ideal? No. Was it the best process to follow to
                            abide by the time limitation? In my opinion - yes.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Homepage</h2>
                        <p>The homepage was a bit of a struggle.</p>
                        <p>
                            The only design provided was for mobile, but we were
                            making a website that needed to look good on mobile,
                            tablet, AND desktop.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The problem here was the animations we wanted on the
                            page. We wanted the “creatures” to jump in from the
                            right-hand side. This means we needed the text that
                            the creatures jumped onto to always be close to the
                            right-hand side.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since we didn’t have the funding or time to
                            implement two completely different designs with
                            different animations on the homepage, I decided to
                            find a different solution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To make life easier, why not keep the exact same
                            design on every screen size, and simply keep the
                            text right-aligned always? Then on larger screens we
                            can fill the empty space with something else and
                            call it a day!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The client liked that idea, so we went forward with
                            it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After implementing some gif techno-wizardry, this is
                            the result we ended up with:
                        </p>
                        <div class="horizontal-image-row phone-laptop">
                            <div class="image-block phone">
                                <img
                                    src="./Images/creature_world_homepage_phone.webp"
                                    loading="lazy"
                                    alt="creature.world homepage on a phone, with animated creatures swinging on the text"
                                />
                            </div>
                            <div class="image-block laptop">
                                <img
                                    src="./Images/creature_world_homepage_laptop.png"
                                    loading="lazy"
                                    alt="creature.world homepage on a laptop, with animated creatures swinging on the text"
                                />
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Info</h2>
                        <p>This was the most straight-forward of the pages.</p>
                        <p>
                            I received a medium-fidelity design, and simply had
                            to put it into code with minor revisions some
                            personal flair.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here’s what the info page ended up looking like:</p>
                        <div class="horizontal-image-row phone-laptop">
                            <div class="image-block phone">
                                <img
                                    src="./Images/creature_world_info_phone.png"
                                    loading="lazy"
                                    alt="creature.world info page on a phone, with a large picture of artwork, and a bio beneath"
                                />
                            </div>
                            <div class="image-block laptop">
                                <img
                                    src="./Images/creature_world_info_laptop.png"
                                    loading="lazy"
                                    alt="creature.world info page on a laptop, with a large picture of artwork, and a bio beneath"
                                />
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <h2>Explore</h2>
                        <p>
                            I had the most creative freedom for this page, which
                            was scary at first, but became a lot of fun once I
                            got going.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The client knew they wanted a “featured articles”
                            section, a gallery to show off their artwork, and an
                            archive section to show off previous work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I took inspiration from their previous portfolio
                            website, dannycole.co and implemented a similar
                            design to the archive pages.
                        </p>
                        <img
                            src="./Images/dannycole_portfolio_site.png"
                            class="constrained-width-image"
                            loading="lazy"
                            alt="Danny Cole's previous portfolio website"
                        />
                        <p>
                            I jumped into Figma and got to designing! Here's
                            what I came up with:
                        </p>
                        <img
                            src="./Images/lfp_explore.png"
                            class="constrained-width-image"
                            loading="lazy"
                            alt="A prototype of the explore page, created in Figma"
                        />
                        <p>
                            The initial idea was to have the featured projects
                            jump the user down to the project in the archive,
                            and the gallery would be an infinitely scrolling
                            carousel.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After showing the first-pass design to the client -
                            much to my surprise - they really liked it and
                            didn’t have any major changes. Who needs multiple
                            iterations when the first one works, I guess!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After putting it into code (and multiple design
                            iterations), here’s what we ended up with:
                        </p>
                        <img
                            src="./Images/creature_world_explore_final.png"
                            class="constrained-width-image"
                            loading="lazy"
                            alt="The final design of the creature.world explore page, implemented on the web"
                        />
                        <p>
                            The one major change we made between the prototype
                            and the implementation was how the selected projects
                            took you to the project block. Instead of making the
                            page scroll down to the archive project (which could
                            be 50 projects down), I came up with the idea of
                            displaying the article right beneath the selected
                            project block when clicking on it.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here’s what that looks like:</p>
                        <img
                            src="./Images/creature_world_explore_selected.png"
                            class="constrained-width-image"
                            loading="lazy"
                            alt="The creature.world explore page with a project selected and the article displayed beneath it"
                        />
                        <p>
                            Another fun challenge was the requirement that
                            everything on the explore page should be
                            customizable with out needing code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’d never done this before, so I started looking
                            into CMS’s and what each of them offered.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My friend had used Strapi before, and after further
                            research it appeared to be a trusted, well-used, and
                            well-loved CMS. For these reasons, I decided to go
                            forward with it!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I ended up hosting my Strapi CMS on a Heroku
                            database, since it was easy to set up and relatively
                            cheap.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I then used Cloudinary for content-delivery since
                            the Heroku filesystem is ephemeral (it deletes all
                            files after every restart).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the end, I had a clean dashboard that could be
                            used by anybody (no coding knowledge necessary!) to
                            update content on the site. The CMS ended up being
                            used on almost every page, delivering content to the
                            homepage, info page, and explore page.

                        <h2>Store</h2>
                        <p>
                            The requirements for the store were pretty simple.
                            Display the featured items on the storefront, have a
                            functional checkout, and use Shopify for everything.
                        </p>
                        <p>Easy enough, right?</p>
                        <p>Well, no.</p>
                        <p>
                            I ran into multiple problems when implementing the
                            store.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First off, Shopify doesn’t let you put a Shopify
                            store under a domain subfolder. Every other page on
                            the site is creature.world/{page}, like
                            creature.world/info and creature.world/explore, so I
                            really wanted creature.world/store to be the store
                            page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, if you want your store to live in a
                            subfolder you have build your Shopify store from
                            scratch, using their API as your only help. At this
                            point in the project, I only had a couple weeks left
                            before launch so I didn’t physically have enough
                            time to build a checkout flow from scratch. I needed
                            to use a Shopify template, and therefore I had to
                            host the site on Shopify and couldn’t link it to a
                            subfolder.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This meant I needed to look for another solution.
                            Either we could buy a new domain, creature.store or
                            something, but that’s when I learned about
                            subdomains! AHA! Instead of creature.world/store, I
                            could put it under store.creature.world. Not as
                            elegant as the former, but it would allow more
                            cohesion between the domains rather than pointing
                            the store at a completely different url.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second issue I faced was building the Shopify
                            template. Shopify only lets you customize your
                            template so much before you have to delve into the
                            code. This meant I had to learn Shopify’s “Liquid”
                            templating language (in only a couple weeks) for
                            creating Shopify templates. Although I was new to
                            the language, it was familiar enough to previous
                            templating languages I’ve used like underscore.js so
                            I was able to get the hang of it quickly (thank
                            goodness).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I didn’t even have time to create a low-fidelity
                            prototype, so I took inspiration from the previous
                            creature world store and ran with it. I also wanted
                            to make the Shopify store look as cohesive as
                            possible with the other parts of the website, so it
                            wouldn’t look like it’s own separate website (even
                            though it was).
                        </p>
                        <p>Here’s what I ended up with:</p>

                            style="margin-bottom: 1rem"

                            style="margin-bottom: 3rem"
                        />
                        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                        <p>
                            Although the project was quite stressful at times
                            due to the time constraints, it was very rewarding
                            to have completed my very first big-time real-world
                            project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And, in the end all that matters is the happiness
                            and satisfaction of the client.
                        </p>
                        <p>So, were they happy?</p>
                        <p>I’m glad to report he was!</p>
                        <p>
                            The client praised the design and implementation of
                            the site, and liked my work so much that they
                            referred me to their friends over at Byline to help
                            them build their website.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It felt amazing to have my hard work recognized, and
                            I’m glad I was given the opportunity to build
                            something cool with Danny Cole and his team.

                                Refine product requirements BEFORE starting any
                                work. The worst thing you can do is design
                                something that wasn’t wanted or needed in the
                                first place

                                Communication is KEY! Maintaining clear lines of
                                dialogue about deadlines and your personal
                                ability to delivery within the given time-frame
                                will pay off dividends in terms of building
                                trust in your business relationships

                                Sometimes it’s okay to promise you can build
                                something even if you’re not sure how to do it.
                                You can always learn it later!

                                Be careful of scope creep. Not only does this
                                delay timelines, it also compromises the trust
                                in your business relationship. Be clear about
                                what is and isn’t included in the project, and
                                make small allowances when necessary (you don’t
                                need to be TOO strict)

                            <span class="gold">Vivid Seats</span>, a
                            ticket-reselling platform that allows fans of all

                            tickets, in order to see their favourite artists or

                        <p>
                            I was working as a

                            <span class="gold">Express.js</span> to build out
                            new features, fix bugs, and port our checkout from

                        <p>
                            I was assigned to the “Checkout 2.0” project a few
                            weeks into my term. This was a large-scale project
                            that involved porting our company’s entire checkout
                            flow from <span class="gold">Java</span> (most of
                            which was written 10+ years ago) to
                            <span class="gold">Next.js</span> and
                            <span class="gold">Express.js</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The intention of this project was to optimize
                            checkout <span class="gold">performance</span> and
                            <span class="gold">developer experience</span>,
                            allowing for better user experience and easier code
                            maintainability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I headed up getting this project over the finish
                            line, knocking out many feature implementations and
                            squashing bugs along the way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We ended up finishing the project far ahead of
                            schedule, and noticed bumps in conversion rates
                            across the board after rolling it out.

                        <p>
                            Additionally, I took the lead in running a
                            performance study of Checkout 2.0, comparing it
                            against our legacy implementation. After running
                            tests and crunching numbers, I found a near
                            <span class="gold"

                            >
                            from checkout start to checkout completion. I
                            presented these findings to upper-management, which
                            thoroughly impressed them, giving us the go-ahead to
                            roll out Checkout 2.0 even faster.

                                I took the

                                several detailed pages outlining the systems we

                                manage at Vivid Seats. Initially, the documents
                                were intended to help onboard future co-op

                        <p>
                            My third co-op was at Tradable Bits, a SaaS company
                            working to make sports and music fans’ experience
                            better by providing media organizations a
                            streamlined way to send out prizes, games, and
                            communications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My role was a
                            <span class="gold">Full-Stack Web Developer</span>,
                            working together with a team of 8 other devs in a
                            15-day Agile sprint framework.

                        <p>
                            Over the course of my co-op term, I was able to lead
                            multiple projects. I started off small at the
                            beginning, working on projects with a one to two
                            week timeframe, but as the term progressed I was
                            able to take on greater responsibility and larger
                            projects. I ended off the term after completing a
                            2-month long project - just in the nick of time!

                                Overhauled the UI of 20+ client-facing pages,
                                while simultaneously
                                <span class="gold"

                                of the back-end. These pages were used by
                                clients to modify their settings for different
                                types of campaign events. Since we had over 20
                                campaign types, a complete overhaul was
                                necessary for each one of these pages. This
                                feature helped

                                feature additions or debugging. Since I was
                                given complete control over the project, I was
                                also able to offer design critiques to our
                                product designers, which were often
                                well-received and led to a further refined user
                                experience.

                            business, I built a website with custom dashboards
                            to streamline her workflow, along with a
                            customer-facing point-of-sale system, complete with
                            shopping cart management and checkout.

                        <h3>The Backstory</h3>
                        <p>
                            My aunt runs a small bakery business, and used to do
                            all of her operations manually and on paper. She
                            received orders by email, then went through a
                            lengthy back-and-forth process to figure out
                            additional requests, costs, location of delivery,
                            etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once orders started rolling in, she would compile a
                            huge spreadsheet of orders (manually inputted of
                            course), which she would print off to track order
                            completion in pencil. As orders rolled in, she
                            needed to print out more and more pages while doing
                            her best to keep track of delivery dates, weekly
                            inventory and batches.
                        </p>
                        <p>TL;DR: It was a nightmare.</p>

                        <p>
                            I realized a better solution was necessary, one that
                            allowed my aunt to focus on her important tasks and
                            leave the menial ones to automated software.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Problem(s)</h3>
                        <p>
                            Before I could begin the project, I needed to
                            identify my aunt’s biggest pain-points. In order to
                            come up with the most effective and minimalist
                            solutions, identifying the root cause of each
                            pain-point was crucial, as one solution may solve
                            multiple symptoms of the same problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After a few 1-on-1 consultations, I identified the 3
                            main divisions of her work, and the problems she was
                            facing in each.

                        <h3>Choosing the Right Tools</h3>
                        <p>
                            I knew I wanted to build a website to solve these
                            problems. Although I had never built one by myself,
                            at the time I was working as a full-stack web
                            developer, so I had some knowledge in the field.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Why a website? Not only is it accessible from any
                            device, the possibilities of the web are endless if
                            you use the right tools.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since I was inexperienced, I figured the best way to
                            learn more would be to ask a professional in the
                            industry. I approached my manager, a software
                            developer with years of experience, and explained
                            the project. He recommended using Next.js and
                            tailwindcss for the front-end, Supabase for the
                            back-end, and Vercel to host the website. All of
                            which are modern tools and easy-to-learn.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also needed a tool for prototyping the UI, so I
                            decided to use Figma - a suggestion from another
                            coworker.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, with no experience with any of those tools, I
                            jumped right in.
                        </p>
                        <div class="step-header">

                            <h3>Management</h3>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            I was keen on tackling the biggest issue my aunt was
                            facing first, so I decided to jump into the second
                            stage in the order process before solving everything
                            else.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since I had already identified key pain-points, I
                            began working on a solution to address as many as
                            possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I began by asking my aunt exactly what information
                            she needed when baking. I identified which
                            information from the order was useful to see, and
                            which was useless. I worked on the design principle
                            of displaying the least amount of information
                            possible. Nothing more, nothing less. Designing in
                            this manner reduces cognitive load, and allows
                            information retrieval to be more efficient.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the end, she needed the total quantities in
                            dozens and in individual goods that needed to be
                            baked per week.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Ideation</h3>
                        <p>
                            I got to work in Figma, and threw together some
                            low-fidelity prototypes as a proof of concept.
                        </p>
                        <img src="./Images/lfp_dashboard.webp" loading="lazy" />
                        <p>
                            I came up with a dashboard that would display only
                            the information she needed, which could be filtered
                            to display only what was necessary for that week. It
                            also had the ability to add and remove the number of
                            items that had already been baked.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I presented this design to my aunt, and she tore it
                            apart. Well, not entirely. But she offered a lot of
                            helpful feedback, which I used to implement my
                            high-fidelity prototype designs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the design language of the high-fidelity
                            designs, I thought I’d keep it consistent with the
                            look and feel of my aunt’s current website, with
                            fonts, colours, and shapes all the same or similar
                            to preserve uniformity.
                        </p>
                        <img
                            style="max-width: 650px"
                            src="./Images/mfp_dashboard.webp"
                            loading="lazy"
                        />
                        <p>
                            Here was the final design of the homepage dashboard.
                            It contained a filter on the left to sort by date, a
                            table of products with total dozens and total items,
                            along with a handy breakdown of order statuses. My
                            aunt didn’t need the ability to add and remove
                            quantities that had been baked, so that feature was
                            scrapped.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To solve the issue of printing out the entire
                            spreadsheet, I added a print feature that allows my
                            aunt to print only the table, showing her what she
                            needs to bake each week. This cuts down the number
                            of pages she was printing from over 10 per week, to
                            1 per week.
                        </p>
                        <img
                            style="max-width: 450px"
                            src="./Images/mfp_dashboard_print.webp"
                            loading="lazy"
                        />
                        <p>
                            The last thing I needed to add in the management
                            step was a way for my aunt to modify orders. In
                            hindsight, there are so many better was I could have
                            implemented this feature, but I was working with
                            time constraints and I needed a solution that would
                            be relatively easy to implement into code.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here's what I came up with:</p>
                        <img
                            src="./Images/all_orders.webp"
                            style="max-width: 650px"
                            loading="lazy"
                            alt="a table displaying order details"
                        />
                        <p>
                            Yep, a spreadsheet. A boring old spreadsheet. Not my
                            proudest moment, as I sought to remove all the
                            problems spreadsheets brought with them when I began
                            this project. However, I did optimize the many pain
                            points my aunt was facing, even while working within
                            the constraints of a spreadsheet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            First was using colours to distinguish between
                            spreadsheet rows. Second, I added protection to
                            editing a row and deleting an order. Since my aunt
                            has to click on the edit button, then click
                            “confirm”, it prevents accidentally wiping any
                            records from the spreadsheet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I figured, since order won’t be inputted manually,
                            there would be a low likelihood that my aunt would
                            need to edit orders at all, so by sticking to a
                            straight-forward and easy to implement solution, I
                            could spend time on the more important parts of the
                            platform.

                            To solve the pain-points in the placement step, I
                            started off by analysing the current ordering flow.

                            Consultations with my aunt and viewing emails from
                            previous customers showed me the steps most
                            customers follow.

                                Wait for a response from my aunt with the order

                        <p>
                            I noticed some problematic user-experience issues in
                            this flow. The biggest offenders were having to
                            navigate to an external platform to place an order
                            and having to wait to receive the order total or
                            calculate the cost in your head. In order to address
                            both customer and client user-experience pain
                            points, I decided to implement a traditional
                            checkout. This would streamline the ordering flow,
                            and solve each of the identified pain points.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            How would it solve them? Customers would be able to
                            order from within martharave.com, eliminating the
                            need for email correspondence. This would save time
                            and effort for the customer and for my aunt. They
                            would also know order totals as they ordered it,
                            since it would be calculated by the software.

                        <p>
                            I began the design phase of the project by
                            researching existing implementations. I looked at a
                            few example of classic Shopify checkouts, and noted
                            things I liked about them as inspiration. A few
                            specific things I liked were the size and placement
                            of the product images and appearance and
                            functionality of the quantity selector.

                        <p>Here are a few of the initial designs:</p>
                        <div class="mfps">
                            <img
                                src="./Images/mfp_products.webp"

                                style="max-width: 650px; margin-bottom: 1rem"
                            />
                            <img
                                src="./Images/mfp_cart.webp"
                                loading="lazy"
                                style="max-width: 650px; margin-bottom: 1rem"
                            />
                            <img
                                src="./Images/mfp_checkout.webp"
                                loading="lazy"
                                style="max-width: 650px"
                            />
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            I experimented with placement of text, different
                            types of buttons and methods to select quantities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After implementing the design I thought most
                            intuitive, I did some live user-testing with my
                            aunt. I had her walk through the checkout flow and
                            identify any points of friction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One thing that I didn’t expect in this process was
                            when she couldn’t understand how to update the
                            quantities of the items. I thought it was very
                            intuitive, but I was wrong.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After showing her alternate designs, she ended up
                            picking a different one that made more sense. This
                            process was very eye-opening and taught me
                            first-hand the importance of user-testing!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And here's a mock I whipped up for the thank-you
                            page after a user is finished checking out:
                        </p>
                        <img
                            src="./Images/thank_you_page.webp"
                            loading="lazy"
                            style="max-width: 650px"
                        />
                        <p>
                            The final feature I wanted to implement in this step
                            is an email that is sent to the user upon order
                            completion. This email would contain all of their
                            order information as well as total cost, which is
                            effectively their order receipt. This removes the
                            need for my aunt to send customers emails to confirm
                            their orders. Due to time constraints, I skipped
                            developing prototypes and instead jumped directly
                            into the implementation which I'll show off at the
                            end.
                        </p>
                        <div class="step-header">
                            <img src="./Images/circle_three.svg" />
                            <h3>Fulfillment</h3>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            The final step in the process was fulfillment. The
                            main things I needed to fix was seeing specific
                            order details, being able to print off order details
                            and tracking completed orders.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once again, I wanted to limit the amount of
                            information that’s displayed to my aunt, preventing
                            information overload.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Ideation</h3>
                        <p>Here's the low fidelity-prototype I started with:</p>
                        <img
                            src="./Images/lfp_order_dashboard.webp"
                            loading="lazy"
                            alt=""
                        />
                        <p>
                            This design attempts to solve all of the given
                            problems, with each “card” displaying only what the
                            customer ordered, a checkbox verification system to
                            keep track of order progress, and a print button to
                            print off the orders.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I experimented with checkboxes, a slider, and having
                            different order progress metrics, like “Baked”
                            instead of “Paid”. I presented all of these designs
                            to my aunt, received valuable feedback, and got to
                            work implementing the high-fidelity prototype.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here is the final design of the order dashboard. A
                            few notable changes were made between low-fidelity
                            and high-fidelity.
                        </p>
                        <img
                            src="./Images/hfp_order_dashboard.webp"
                            loading="lazy"
                            alt=""
                            style="max-width: 650px"
                        />
                        <p>
                            The first change I made is placing order status
                            information into icons with pop-ups. This reduces
                            the amount of page real estate that’s taken up with
                            text, and since they are icons the meaning behind
                            them can be intuited. Additionally, if my aunt ever
                            forgets what an icon means, she can hover over it to
                            to display a pop-up description.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, the cards expand when the top-right
                            arrow is clicked, displaying the rest of the order
                            details. That way my aunt still has access to all
                            the necessary information, but isn’t bombarded with
                            all of it at once when only half of it is required
                            at a time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, I added a more fleshed-out print layout,
                            which was tailored to my aunt’s exact needs. Since
                            she wanted to print off each order and attach it to
                            the physical order, she wanted all of the order
                            information to be displayed. I jumped immediately to
                            a medium-fidelity prototype due to time constraints,
                            and implemented the high-fidelity prototype directly
                            into the website after receiving feedback from my
                            aunt.
                        </p>

                        />
                        <p></p>
                        <h3>Final Design</h3>
                        <p>
                            After receiving more feedback on the high-fidelity
                            prototypes, I got to work implementing the website
                            in code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I used a Next.js and tailwindcss front-end (hosted
                            on Vercel) and a PostgreSQL back-end (hosted on
                            Supabase). For my data queries I used custom
                            PostgreSQL functions, to optimize query efficiency.

                            At the end of the project, my aunt requested I build
                            something to keep track of her ingredient purchases.
                            I obliged and quickly whipped up a finances page.
                            This page allows my aunt to input the quantities and
                            prices of ingredients she buys from the grocery
                            store, which will be plotted on a graph.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before, the only data she had to keep track of her
                            expenses is her credit card statement. Now, she has
                            a detailed breakdown of how much she’s spending and
                            when.

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>
                            After everything was implemented, all feedback was
                            received and incorporated, I handed the website off
                            to my aunt. She used it right away to process orders
                            for the Christmas season, and absolutely loved it.
                            She also told me multiple accounts from customers
                            that emailed her to let her know how much they liked
                            the storefront and checkout process. A success
                            across the board!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was glad to hear all my hard work had paid off,
                            and I fully credit this towards the systematic
                            approach I took when addressing the pain points my
                            aunt was facing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All in all, the key pain points were addressed and
                            solved in each step of the process, and although my
                            aunt had some minor critiques after using it, the
                            majority of the platform was an immediate success.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All told, this platform ended up cutting time spent
                            on operations by 15%, likely reduced customer time
                            expenditure as well, and most importantly -
                            decreased the amount of stress and multi-tasking in
                            my aunt’s workflow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also - fun fact: everything on this platform besides
                            paying for a domain name is completely free. And,
                            since I took her website off of GoDaddy and put it
                            on Vercel, she ended up paying LESS than before,
                            which resulted in a 75% reduction in website
                            expenses.
